    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      At <strong>Team Chain</strong>, we believe that technology should empower
      collaboration—not limit it. Our mission is to build decentralized
      solutions that connect teams across borders and time-zones in a secure,
      transparent, and trustless environment.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We combine blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and real-time
      automation to simplify how teams collaborate and manage resources.
      Whether you're an independent developer, a growing startup, or a large
      organization, our platform brings structure and clarity to every task.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Blockchain-based task management</li>
      <li>Automated reward distribution</li>
      <li>On-chain verifiable progress</li>
      <li>Secure wallet integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      To redefine digital teamwork with transparency, performance, and long-term
      trust at the core. We envision a world where contributions speak louder
      than titles—and where everyone owns the value they create.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>
      A collective of developers, designers, and innovators who believe in
      permissionless collaboration. We are committed to building a future where
      technology aligns incentives and amplifies human potential.
